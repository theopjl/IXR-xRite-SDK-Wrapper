xRite wrapper

I am under windows and I want to create a python wrapper (compatible with python 3.11) of the i1Pro SDK.
The i1Pro SDK is implemented inside i1Pro.h and MeasurementConditions.h
I also placed i1Pro.lib, in the same directory, needed in order to use iPro64.dll (also in the same directory) 

I joint to this prompt my personnal C++ wrapper wich is implemend in iveyeone.h and iveyeone.cpp with a corresponding eyeone.cpp exemple.
This wrapper use my own C++ image processing library.

For the final python wrapper I only want to use numpy to manage my data structures, the spectra and the color.


Colorchecker

I want to detect a Colorchecker by using 4 aruco markers.

These aruco markers, which will be printer on a white paper, will help to detect the corners of a colorchecked placed on this printed paper.

Based on python and opencv, I want 2 scripts: 

- one generating a PDF file where the aruco markers will be placed (A3 format with the good distance between the aruco markers) for detecting the xRite 24 patchs Colorchecker or the xRite Digital SG Colorchecker. A rectangle dedicated to place accuratly the Colorchecker will be displayed in the PDF file.

- a second which will take as input a RGB image (an 8 or 16 bits image) where the printed paper with the aruco markers (printed) and the colorchecker (placed on the rectangle) will be detected. 
It will ouptut the colorcher image, the type of the detected colorchecker, a json file with the type of the color and an array of RGB values corresponding to each patchs present in the colorchecker. 
It will take, as an option, the intrinsec parameters of the camera used to take the picture. 
It will output, as an option, if the colorchecker is the Digital SG, the RGB values after a ligth compensation process based on the black, gray and white patches present at the peripheral and at the center of the colorchecked.
